Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open source system for managing [containerized applications]
across multiple hosts. It provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance,
and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running
production workloads at scale using a system called [Borg],
combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

Kubernetes is hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ([CNCF]).
If your company wants to help shape the evolution of
technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically scheduled,
and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF.
For details about who's involved and how Kubernetes plays a role,
read the CNCF [announcement].

Try our [interactive tutorial].

Take a free course on [Scalable Microservices with Kubernetes].

To use Kubernetes code as a library in other applications, see the [list of published components](https://git.k8s.io/kubernetes/staging/README.md).
Use of the `k8s.io/kubernetes` module or `k8s.io/kubernetes/...` packages as libraries is not supported.

----

The [community repository] hosts all information about
building Kubernetes from source, how to contribute code
and documentation, who to contact about what, etc.

If you want to build Kubernetes right away there are two options:

----

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/k8s.io
cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.io
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make
```
----

```
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes
cd kubernetes
make quick-release
```
